                <p class="article_text">
                    At least two people have died and more than 50 are missing after a mine collapsed in northern China.<br>
                    <br>President Xi Jinping has ordered a search and rescue mission following the collapse at around 17:13 local time (09:13 GMT) on Wednesday.<br>
                    <br>Six injured individuals have been rescued from the site so far.<br>
                    <br>More than 200 rescue workers are at the scene, according to state news agency Xinhua. The mine is located in Alxa League, in Inner Mongolia region.<br>
                    <br>State broadcaster CCTV reported that the collapse occurred in a shaft operated by Xinjing Coal Mining Company.<br>
                    <br>Mines in Inner Mongolia are some of China's top coal producers.<br>
                    <br>Accidents are not uncommon in China, where the industry safety regulations can be poorly enforced. In December 2020, 23 miners died after a carbon monoxide leak at a coal mine.<br>
                    <br>And in January 2021, 10 miners were killed in a blast at a gold mine in Shandong province.
