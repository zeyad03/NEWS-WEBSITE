                <p class="article_text">
                    Intensive talks are due to start later between ministers and the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) after the union halted next week's 48-hour strike in England.<br>
                    <br>Health Secretary Stephen Barclay will sit down with RCN leader Pat Cullen to discuss a compromise deal to end the stand-off over pay.<br>
                    <br>The talks are likely to focus on next year's pay rise, which is due in April.<br>
                    <br>One option is to backdate it by several months, effectively giving nurses an extra pay boost for part of this year.<br>
                    <br>Nurses - and other NHS staff except doctors - were given an average of 4.75% this year.<br>
                    <br>That award had prompted a wave of strikes by unions representing nurses, ambulance staff and physios, who wanted an above-inflation increase.<br>
                    <br>The Treasury has refused to sanction any revisiting of that award, fearing it would fuel inflation.<br>
                    <br>But the resumption of talks came after the government set out its plan for next year's pay award.<br>
                    <br>It has suggested an increase of 3.5% for all NHS staff in its submission to the independent NHS Pay Review Body.<br>
                    <br>The final offer though could be higher - in previous years the pay review body has recommended more than the government initially offered, to which the government has subsequently agreed.<br>
                    <br>If next year's pay award is backdated to before April, it would effectively mean a double boost in pay for those months.<br>
                    <br>Speaking ahead of the talks, Ms Cullen said: "We will put our plans on the table, they can put their plans on the table - but I'm confident that we will come out with a fair pay settlement for our nursing staff."<br>
                    <br>She added they would make sure no stone was left unturned and a fair pay deal was reached as quickly as possible so they could end the strikes.<br>
                    <br>Government sources said they were delighted to be back talking again and were determined to reach a "fair and reasonable settlement".<br>
                    <br>Other health unions said they were disappointed not to have been invited to the discussions.<br>
                    <br>A spokesman for one, Unison, said the government's decision to meet just the RCN alone - and not them as well - would do "nothing to solve the NHS pay dispute".<br>
                    <br>As the talks were taking place, the union announced a walkout across nine of England's 10 ambulance services on 8 March. A smaller number of other services, including hospitals and NHS Blood and Transplant, will also be involved.<br>
                    <br><b>'Sigh of relief'</b><br>
                    <br>Next week's walkout by RCN members in England, from 1 to 3 March, was set to be the biggest strike of this winter's pay dispute, with half of frontline services affected.<br>
                    <br>The action would have included nursing staff from intensive care units, cancer care and other services that were previously exempted.<br>
                    <br>Sir Julian Hartley, chief executive at NHS Providers which represents health managers, said the NHS would be "breathing a sign of relief".<br>
                    <br>"The past weeks have seen a worrying escalation of industrial action, which has hit patients hard. This is the glimmer of hope we all needed," he added.<br>
                    <br>The NHS, however, faces further industrial action from unions representing ambulance drivers and junior doctors, and more strike dates could yet be announced.<br>
                    <br>The Scottish government has offered NHS staff - including nurses - a new pay offer for the coming year which includes a one-off payment and an average salary rise of 6.5% from April.<br>
                    <br>In Wales, nurses are currently being balloted over a new pay deal from the Welsh government, and the RCN has put some planned walkouts for February on hold.
